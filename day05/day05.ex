  --- Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This? ---

  Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.

  A nice string is one with all of the following properties:

  - It contains at least three vowels (aeiou only), like aei, xazegov, or aeiouaeiouaeiou.
  - It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like xx, abcdde (dd), or
    aabbccdd (aa, bb, cc, or dd).
  - It does not contain the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy, even if they are part of one of
    the other requirements.

  For example:

  - ugknbfddgicrmopn is nice because it has at least three vowels (u...i...o...),
    a double letter (...dd...), and none of the disallowed substrings.
  - aaa is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even
    though the letters used by different rules overlap.
  - jchzalrnumimnmhp is naughty because it has no double letter.
  - haegwjzuvuyypxyu is naughty because it contains the string xy.
  - dvszwmarrgswjxmb is naughty because it contains only one vowel.

  How many strings are nice?

  --- Part Two ---

  Realizing the error of his ways, Santa has switched to a better model of determining
  whether a string is naughty or nice. None of the old rules apply, as they are all clearly ridiculous.

  Now, a nice string is one with all of the following properties:

  - It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping,
    like xyxy (xy) or aabcdefgaa (aa), but not like aaa (aa, but it overlaps).
  - It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them, like xyx,
    abcdefeghi (efe), or even aaa.

  For example:

  - qjhvhtzxzqqjkmpb is nice because is has a pair that appears twice (qj) and a letter
    that repeats with exactly one letter between them (zxz).
  - xxyxx is nice because it has a pair that appears twice and a letter that repeats
    with one between, even though the letters used by each rule overlap.
  - uurcxstgmygtbstg is naughty because it has a pair (tg) but no repeat with a single
    letter between them.
  - ieodomkazucvgmuy is naughty because it has a repeating letter with one between (odo),
    but no pair that appears twice
