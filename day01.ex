  --- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---

  Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building,
  but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a
  little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and
  then follows the instructions one character at a time.

  An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor,
  and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.

  The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep;
  he will never find the top or bottom floors.

  For example:

  (()) and ()() both result in floor 0.
  ((( and (()(()( both result in floor 3.
  ))((((( also results in floor 3.
  ()) and ))( both result in floor -1 (the first basement level).
  ))) and )())()) both result in floor -3.

  To what floor do the instructions take Santa?
